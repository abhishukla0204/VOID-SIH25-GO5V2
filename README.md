## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep blue (`#3b82f6`) for navigation and primary actions
- **Secondary**: Purple (`#8b5cf6`) for detection features
- **Success**: Green (`#10b981`) for system status
- **Warning**: Amber (`#f59e0b`) for medium risk alerts
- **Error**: Red (`#ef4444`) for high risk scenarios

### Theme
- **Dark Mode**: Default theme with dark backgrounds (`#0f172a`, `#1e293b`)
- **Typography**: Clean, modern font stack with clear hierarchy
- **Icons**: Material Design icons for consistency

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Risk Assessment Pipeline
1. **Environmental Data Collection** - Simulated sensor readings (rainfall, temperature, seismic activity)
2. **Risk Calculation** - Multi-factor algorithm combining environmental factors
3. **Alert Generation** - Threshold-based notification system
4. **Cross-Component Communication** - Props-based state sharing between Dashboard and App

### Detection Workflow
1. **Image Processing** - Static image analysis with pre-computed results
2. **Confidence Scoring** - ML model confidence simulation
3. **Bounding Box Rendering** - Visual overlay of detected objects
4. **Statistics Tracking** - Detection count and performance metrics

## üìä Mock Data System

The application includes sophisticated mock data generation:

- **Realistic Environmental Simulation**: Weather patterns, seismic activity, geological factors
- **Detection Results**: Pre-computed ML detection outputs with bounding boxes
- **Risk Calculations**: Dynamic risk scoring with configurable high-risk scenarios
- **Historical Data**: 24-hour trend simulation for dashboards

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/         # Main application pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/        # Configuration and environment setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/        # Static assets and images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Component Patterns
- **Page Components**: Follow common props interface (`systemStatus`, `connectionStatus`, `onRiskDataUpdate`)
- **State Management**: Centralized in App.jsx with props drilling
- **Styling**: Material-UI `sx` prop for component-level styling

### Adding New Features
1. Update navigation in `App.jsx`
2. Create page component following existing patterns
3. Add configuration flags in `src/config/index.js`
4. Update routing logic in `renderCurrentPage()`

## üß™ Testing

The application includes test configuration for:
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing (setup ready)

## üì¶ Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates optimized production build in `dist/` directory with:
- Code splitting and tree shaking
- Source maps for debugging
- Asset optimization
- Environment variable injection
